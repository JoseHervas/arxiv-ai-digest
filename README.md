# ArXiv AI Digest

A weekly curated digest of recent AI / LLM / ML papers on arXiv, with summaries, analysis, and links.

Every week, more than 1,000 new papers are uploaded to arXiv in areas related to AI, LLMs, and machine learning. Keeping up with this pace is almost impossible, so I built a custom pipeline that:

- Scans new submissions on arXiv in relevant categories (e.g. cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG, etc.)
- Generates readable summaries and commentary / “why it matters” notes
- Publishes the digest weekly, with metadata and links to the original papers

The goal is to reduce the cognitive load of skimming hundreds of new papers and highlight the most interesting or impactful ones.
